# Simple_Linear_Regression

In this project, I used a simple linear regression to predict an employee's salary, based on how many years of experience they have in the workforce.

This project was my first introduction to machine learning, and understanding regression models.

To speed up model training, Google Colab was used.

In the "Code" file, an executable .py file can be found, along with a .ipynb file to visualize the model's results on the dataset. Additionally, the dataset used can be found in the "Data" file.

This project was completed through a course on Udemy in July but was only added to GitHub recently.
